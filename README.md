# Blender Execute Script

This is a python script for Blender that executes a script. Kind of redundant you might think. But as far as I can tell, Blender doesn't have a menu or hotkey to run scripts. You have to open the Text Editor and the open the script in Blender then click the "run" button. I don't think that button has a hotkey either.

But this script registers itself as an Add On so if you install it then it will always load and add itself to the bottom of the Render Menu (I know, it's the wrong menu, I don't know where to put it yet). I believe I can automatically assign it a hotkey, but I'm too new to Blender to know what good one to pick. Right now I picked cntl-alt-x (for execute). I put it up here for not and will show it to some people and see what they think.
